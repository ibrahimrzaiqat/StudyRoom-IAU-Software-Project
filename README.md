StudyRoom App

Project Description:

StudyRoom is an innovative platform designed to facilitate collaborative learning among students. It allows users to join or create virtual study rooms tailored to specific languages, subjects, chapters, and lessons. The app fosters interaction, knowledge sharing, and efficient studying through many communication features and structured group discussions.
