Persona 3: Jacob Williams(College Proffesor)

Age: 35

Occupation: Calculus Proffesor

Location: Georgia,U.S

Language: Fluent English and Spanish, intermediate French


Background:
Jacob is a college professor who teaches calculus to a diverse group of students. He frequently uses technology to deliver lectures and assign coursework. While he’s comfortable with basic online tools, he finds switching between multiple platforms for communication, lectures, and student interaction inefficient. Jacob wants a centralized, intuitive solution to manage his classes, communicate with students, and deliver engaging online lectures.
Goals:
-Simplify communication with students by using a single platform for messaging and announcements.

-Conduct seamless online lectures with features like screen sharing and real-time Q&A.

-Create virtual rooms for office hours or group discussions to address student queries.

Frustrations:
-Switching between multiple tools (email, chat apps, video conferencing platforms) to manage class activities.

-Dealing with technical issues during live lectures, such as lag or connection drops.

System Requirements Specification (SRS):


Functional Requirements:

Create open servers  based on language, subject, chapter, and lesson.
Create private servers  based on language, subject, chapter, and lesson.
join open servers  based on language, subject, chapter, and lesson.
chat messages
Videos
audio
screen sharing
white board 
Controls for educators(i.e disallowing muke for students, cameras, etc)
log in system (authentication)
built in white board 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Non-functional Requirements:

Secure server management.
Scalability to handle multiple users simultaneously.
Include mechanisms to back up server data periodically.
Allow recovery of data in case of application failure.
Provide support for multiple languages to cater to users worldwide.
The application should be platform-independent and runnable on major operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux, Phones).
The system must handlea big amount of concurrent users without significant performance degradation.
Response time for creating or joining a server should not exceed 2 seconds.
The system should be designed to accommodate future growth, such as adding more subjects, chapters, or languages.
The CLI should have clear instructions and an intuitive flow to ensure ease of use for non-technical users.
Minimal navigation steps for key features like joining or creating servers.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Design Phase for the CLI:

Components:

User Management: Handles login (if implemented) and user information.
Study Server Management: Manages the creation, joining, and listing of study servers.
Messaging System (optional): Enables communication within servers.

Flow:

CLI inputs → Business Logic Layer → Data Storage (e.g., in-memory or database).

Database Schema:

Table: Users
Columns: UserID, Name, LanguagePreference

Table: Servers
Columns: ServerID, Language, Subject, Chapter, Lesson

Table: Messages (Optional)
Columns: MessageID, ServerID, UserID, Content, Timestamp


Creat Classes based on the Database Schema:

User:Attributes include name, language preference, etc.
Server:Attributes include language, subject, chapter, and lesson.
System:A central class to manage users and servers.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
CLI:

Importos2 (The CLI File) Rename it !!!!!!!!!!!!! CLI_Project.py
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Programming Languages:

Frontend(UI):
JS:Ideal for building interactive, dynamic, and responsive UI.
HTML/CSS:Basic technologies for structuring and styling the web pages.
TypeScript:Catching bugs and improve maintainability

Backend:
Python:Simplicity and readablity
or
Node.js:Great for building scalable web applications, and it uses JS which makes it simpler becasue we are using the same languages on frontend and backend.

Database:
MongoDB(NoSQL): Flecing and scales well with rapid changes, since we have user profiles, messagges, etc.


Authentications:
JWT (JSON Web Tokens): For securing the app and managing user sessions.
